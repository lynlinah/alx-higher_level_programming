A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure consisting of rows and columns. Each element in the matrix is referred to by its row and column index.
You can perform various operations on matrices using nested lists. Here are some common operations:

Accessing elements: Use indexing with row and column indices.
Modifying elements: Assign a new value to a specific element using indexing.
Matrix addition: Add corresponding elements from two matrices of the same dimensions.
Matrix subtraction: Subtract corresponding elements from two matrices of the same dimensions.
Matrix multiplication: Multiply two matrices following the matrix multiplication rules.
Transposition: Swap the rows and columns of a matrix.
In addition to nested lists, you can also use NumPy, a popular numerical computing library, to work with matrices in Python. NumPy provides a multidimensional array object that offers more efficient and convenient operations on matrices.
